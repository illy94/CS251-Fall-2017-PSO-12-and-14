Hello everyone,

Hope you are enjoying the long weekend. Here are the notes used in last PSO section: 
https://github.com/priyankjain/CS251-Fall-2017-PSO-12-and-14

This would be our non-official (not tied to Purdue) PSO related repository where I would be putting in all code discussed in the PSO.

We would be covering following topics this Tuesday:
- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Hash Search
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick sort
- Merge sort
- Heap sort
- Count sort

Re-iterating two important announcements from last PSO:
- I would stop answering any project related emails 24 hours before the deadline
- For any regrade requests related to project/assignments/exams drop me a small note related to the issue and that would be addressed within 3 working days.

Thanks!
Priyank
