1. Given an array, return an array as the same size of the given
array, with value being the product of each element in the array except self.
Example input: arr: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Example output: result: [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]
Here arr[1] = 2 and result[1] = 60. 60 is the product of all elements in original array except the element at index 1.
- Follow up: Can you do it without using division operator?
- Follow up: Can you do it without using extra space? The result array doesn't count as extra space.
